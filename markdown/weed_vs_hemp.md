for those of you who know me from other places, you may know im a lover for all things hemp, and also all things cannabis so i wanted to cover the diffrences between the 2 plants.

So firstly we need to cover the genotypes of cannabis, there are 2 main genotypes, indica, and stevia, there is also hybrib but we'll cover that later on.
Basiclly indica or indica domient strains, is one which is dominant in the idica genotypes.

Likewise Stavia or Steiva dominet strains consist of Stieva geneotypes.

## cannabionds
there are a large number of cannabionds present in both hemp and cannabis all with there own effects. Msst of these cannabionds are still being researched.

what actully are cannabionds i hear you ask? well they are lipids that bind to the ecannabiond system and alter functionailty slightly.

but here the more commonly kown ones that i know what they do, if anyone knows anything more about other cannabionds that haven't been listed, please feel free to send me a pull request.
