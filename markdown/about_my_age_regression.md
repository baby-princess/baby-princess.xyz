so i thought id share the details of my life as an age regressor.

so for a small overview for those of you who do not know what age regression is, basiclly age regression is where a person feels a mental age that is younger then physcial age, this then leads to actions in which a person of that age would do. The reasoning behind this is, life is pretty shit honestly, so this is a way of keeping me sane, by allowing me to relive my happiest moments.

Everyone that is an age regressor has there age regression age, or sometimes refered to as there little age, or a range of ages, this is normally determinded by prefrences, or there envrionment around them . For me personally i range anywhere between 6 months to 3 years old, which is a fairly broad range. Most of the time, i'm a 6 month old.

This is mostly becuase im incontinent, and very regularly wet and/or mess myself, and 99.9% of the time i won't even notice it, so in a way i am always the 6 month old baby :P.
