Hello there, you might be wondering who i am, what i do, why i do what i do etc. so i will fill you in.


Whats with the diapers and baby items, and the name "baby princess" i hear you ask to yourself, but not to me, becuase your monitor is in the way :P. Well i am incontient, and not really potty trained, this is mostly not by choice ethier, so i am in dipaers 24/7/365. I enjoy the whole baby thing, not becuase its a fetish, becuase it is not (see this wikipedia article, insted it is an idea known as age regression (see this article for correct information). 

Basiclly, i do the whole "baby thing" for 1 reason, to keep me sane, and to stop me from wanting to kill myself, becuase incontient people are pushed away from everyone, socially isolated, and very unlikley to get a job. However from the orginal reason, more reasons stems from it, such as it makes me feel cuter then i normally do in the real world, baby clothes are super comfortable, and paci's help with anxity.

so the baby part just stuck, and princesses are cute, so thats where it came from.

do not be fooled, i do, do other things aside from being a baby, im a firm beliver in libre software, i have big inrest in the atomy and uses of the hemp plant, i enjoy speedrunning video games, reading, cooking, machinics and learning

so yeah thats about it for now i guess :)
