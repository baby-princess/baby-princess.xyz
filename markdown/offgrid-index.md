here you will find anything and everything about my plans to live off the grid, and a collection of pages explain how, and why i choose to live off the grid.

## relation to libreism
living off the gird is the most libre home you can have, more so if its in the woods, or remote.

## pages about my jurney as an offgridder

## what i will have

contradicotry to what people think, you can have a life pretty close to the 21st centry by living off grid, so heres my list of definte will haves.
* a network connection
* a laptop (a thinkpad)
* my server
* electricty (from some other means)
* lights (becuase im not a bat)
* my own farm with plants and animals
* books
* a hoover
* clothes
* hot water
* heating

## i will not have
there are a few things i refuse to have in or near to my offgrid house.

* nonrenewable energy (becuase im in the woods, i don't want to have oil be pumped in)
* motorways (they are horrible, noisey, bad for your lungs, and smell gross)
* predefinded paths around the woods (this shows that it is probably a space owned by a company or consuil)
* the council (council houses are a shit hole, as are the estates they work in, i know this as ive grown up in them)
* the police presence (i wish to live on my own in the woods, i do not wish to get kocks at my door, yes i will probably be growing hemp, however this will be for personal use, and even if i am growing weed too, again it will be for personal use, grown in my own farm, for my own use, i do not in any way wish to be around the gangs that grow it, to deal it (which is pretty silly anyway, as its more expensive now that its prohibited, so good job, you just fueled these markets you are trying to stop ;) )
* train lines (see the resaoning behind motorways, though trains aren't as bad, they are still not great)

## things i might have, but might not
there are a few things im still uncertain if ill have them or not when i do actully go off grid
* a mobile phone (becuase they can be used to track you, but are usful for contacting people)
* a camper van (yes they are not green exactly, but they do allow me to move around whenever i feel like it, so i can see the world as and when i choose)
* a job ( money will eventually become pointless, but would probably keep me entertained)
* beer, cider, cocktails etc (sometimes alchol is good, but distilling your own is a massive pain, and also dangruous as it can explode if its too hot)
* supermarket accssess ( i wish to be as far away from the "system" as i can, however i don't think i could bring myself to say kill an animal for meat, so ill let someone else do it)
* buthers (see supermarkets above)
* smoking products exculding tobacco ( becuase i do like a good bit of weed, like the next person, but it still forces me to be connected to the moneytraiy system more)
